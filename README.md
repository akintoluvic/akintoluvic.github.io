 My Portfolio Page

 It has been long that I have been postponing the building of my portfolio, despite the fact that it is a good marketing tool for me as a web developer. My excuse has always been that the design is not good enough. Or probably because I have been reading stuffs like this;

 " As a web developer, web designer, UX professional, etc.—you’ll eventually need an eye-catching, client-landing portfolio."

 While the above may be true, you are better off building one and upgrading it over time because the eye-catcthing and client-landing part comes after several iteration. As such, this article and more to come after it will be about 'How I built My Portfolio Site'. I hope you will join me and build yours too or update your existing one.

 The Structural Layout

 I am starting with a basic structure which includes;
 a navbar
 an header
 a projects section
